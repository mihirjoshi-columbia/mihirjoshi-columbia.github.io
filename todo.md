TODO:
- two user system, one user uploads recipes, other user consumes 

- add upload portal that allows either user of the website to upload their own recipes. The recipe is for a full meal and will indicate what you should eat alongside it (i.e. if the recipe calls for pasta, it will indicate that you should eat it with a side of bread)

- either user can then poll the website saying she wants to eat a certain type of protein (i.e. chicken, fish, etc.) and the website will return a list of recipes that match her preferences alongside a grocery list of ingredients she needs to buy to make the meal
